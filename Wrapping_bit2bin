1.Drag bit file generated from vivado to the folder-build.
2.Excute build.bat
3.Drag BOOT.BIN into SD card


(There's only one line in build.bat. 
"C:\Xilinx\Vivado\2019.2\bin\bootgen -arch zynqmp -image bootgen.bif -o BOOT.BIN -w"
Make sure the directory of bootgen is correct if there's any problem.)
